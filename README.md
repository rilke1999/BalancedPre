# BalancedPre

In this repository I will collect everything about my OpenHArdware Project of a Balanced Preamplifier Test Plattform

## Why did I start this project?

I would like to build a preamp from scratch as a pure learning exercise.
## Will it be usefull for anyone else ?

most probably not.
## What does it consist of

- Input Switching board with latching relays and MUSES based Volume Control
- 4 Balanced Input and two switchable Outputs
- STM32 based Controller for display and 2 rotary encoders the SPI busses to controll the relays and te Colume Contol
- - Software
